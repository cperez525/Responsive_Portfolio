        <!--Bio-->
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Cris. I'm a full stack developer-in-training currently living in Houston, Texas. A native of
          the tri-state area, I moved to Houston in mid-2001 and remained in Houston after my high-school
          graduatation to study music at the University of Houston. After being forced to leave school after my junior
          year, I began singing with Houston Grand Opera.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, I began working for Gene By Gene, a DNA testing company, under their subsidiary Family Tree DNA -
          their Genetic Genealogy branch.
          I began as a customer service representative, working in that position for roughly 18 months before being
          promoted to a higher level group project liaison.
          After another 16 months in that position, I was promoted to become a manual QA tester, a job I hold
          currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in the QA position, I have taught myself some SQL and C# to both aid our automation QAs in
          their work and translate my own written test cases into functioning nightly automation to catch
          bugs in our website and improve the speed at which I can find good examples to fit my test cases in our
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the technical skills I'm developing at work, I am also currently developing an overall greater
          foundation in coding by attending the University of Texas at Austin's Full-Stack Development prgoram, through
          which
          I have already learned a great many HTML and CSS concepts, and am in the process of learning Javascript. I am
          excited
          to have had this opportunity to learn through such a reputable program, and am already realizing after only a
          few weeks
          just how much more I'm capable of than I was prior to the start of classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love dogs (grew up with two beagles), like both playing and watching many sports, love the performing arts
          (especially music), and as a car enthusiast, I love to drive. I am learning more and more that I enjoy coding
          and programming,
          and I am excited to move my career in the development direction!
        </p>
