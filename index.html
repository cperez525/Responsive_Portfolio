          Hello! My name is Cris. I'm a full stack developer-in-training currently living in Houston, Texas. Originally
          from Brooklyn, New York, I moved to Houston in mid-2004 to begin high school, and remained in Houston after
          graduatation to study music at the University of Houston.
          I was forced to withdraw from my studies after my junior
          year due to personal and financial difficulties, but was able to start my career as an opera singer earlier
          than most, and continued to develop as a musician for several years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, I began working for Gene By Gene, a DNA testing company, under their subsidiary Family Tree DNA -
          their Genetic Genealogy branch.
          I began as a customer service representative, working in that position for roughly 18 months before being
          promoted to a higher level group project liaison.
          After another 16 months in that position, I was promoted to become a manual QA tester, a job I hold
          currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in this
          position, I have taught myself some SQL and C# to both aid our automation QAs in their work and be able to
          translate my written test cases into
          functioning nightly automation to catch bugs in our website and improve the speed at which I can find good
          examples to fit my test cases in our database.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like both playing and watching many sports, love the performing arts (especially music), and as a car
          enthusiast, I love to drive.
          I am learning more and more that I enjoy coding and programming, and I am excited to move my career in the
          development direction!
        </p>
